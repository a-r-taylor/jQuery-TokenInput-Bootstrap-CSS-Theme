#jquery-tokeninput-bootstrap-sass-theme

This is a css bootstrappy theme for jQuery Tokeninput http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput. It styles the tokeninput field to blend in with the bootstrap theme.

It requires bootstrap-sass https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass.

##Use

For use with Rails 3. May work elsewhere, but not tested.

This css file works with the facebook theme option of jQuery Tokeninput, so include 'theme: "facebook"' in the initialization. Then place this css file in one of your assets directories and include it in your application.css file (or elsewhere).
